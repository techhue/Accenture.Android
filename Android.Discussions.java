___________________________________________

There are three key loops you may be interested in monitoring within your activity:

The entire lifetime of an activity happens between the first call to onCreate(Bundle) through to a single final call to onDestroy(). An activity will do all setup of "global" state in onCreate(), and release all remaining resources in onDestroy(). For example, if it has a thread running in the background to download data from the network, it may create that thread in onCreate() and then stop the thread in onDestroy().

The visible lifetime of an activity happens between a call to onStart() until a corresponding call to onStop(). During this time the user can see the activity on-screen, though it may not be in the foreground and interacting with the user. Between these two methods you can maintain resources that are needed to show the activity to the user. For example, you can register a BroadcastReceiver in onStart() to monitor for changes that impact your UI, and unregister it in onStop() when the user no longer sees what you are displaying. The onStart() and onStop() methods can be called multiple times, as the activity becomes visible and hidden to the user.

The foreground lifetime of an activity happens between a call to onResume() until a corresponding call to onPause(). During this time the activity is in visible, active and interacting with the user. An activity can frequently go between the resumed and paused states -- for example when the device goes to sleep, when an activity result is delivered, when a new intent is delivered -- so the code in these methods should be fairly lightweight.


The entire lifecycle of an activity is defined by the following Activity methods. All of these are hooks that you can override to do appropriate work when the activity changes state. All activities will implement onCreate(Bundle) to do their initial setup; many will also implement onPause() to commit changes to data and prepare to pause interacting with the user, and onStop() to handle no longer being visible on screen. 

	You should always call up to your superclass when implementing these methods.


Note the "Killable" column in the above table -- for those methods that are marked as being killable, after that method returns the process hosting the activity may be killed by the system at any time without another line of its code being executed. Because of this, you should use the onPause() method to write any persistent data (such as user edits) to storage. 

	In addition, the method onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle) is called before placing the activity in such a background state, allowing you to save away any dynamic instance state in your activity into the given Bundle, to be later received in onCreate(Bundle) if the activity needs to be re-created. See the Process Lifecycle section for more information on how the lifecycle of a process is tied to the activities it is hosting. Note that it is important to save persistent data in onPause() instead of onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) because the latter is not part of the lifecycle callbacks, so will not be called in every situation as described in its documentation.

Be aware that these semantics will change slightly between applications targeting

___________________________________________
onConfigurationChange Recommended Practice
___________________________________________

Caution: Handling the configuration change yourself can make it much more difficult to use alternative resources, because the system does not automatically apply them for you. This technique should be considered a last resort when you must avoid restarts due to a configuration change and is not recommended for most applications.

	
 	android:configChanges=["mcc", "mnc", "locale",
                                 "touchscreen", "keyboard", "keyboardHidden",
                                 "navigation", "screenLayout", "fontScale",
                                 "uiMode", "orientation", "density",
                                 "screenSize", "smallestScreenSize"]


If the configuration of the device (as defined by the Configuration class) changes, then anything displaying a user interface will need to update to match that configuration. Because Activity is the primary mechanism for interacting with the user, it includes special support for handling configuration changes.

Unless you specify otherwise, a configuration change (such as a change in screen orientation, language, input devices, etc) will cause your current activity to be destroyed, going through the normal activity lifecycle process of onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy() as appropriate. If the activity had been in the foreground or visible to the user, once onDestroy() is called in that instance then a new instance of the activity will be created, with whatever savedInstanceState the previous instance had generated from onSaveInstanceState(Bundle).

This is done because any application resource, including layout files, can change based on any configuration value. Thus the only safe way to handle a configuration change is to re-retrieve all resources, including layouts, drawables, and strings. Because activities must already know how to save their state and re-create themselves from that state, this is a convenient way to have an activity restart itself with a new configuration.

In some special cases, you may want to bypass restarting of your activity based on one or more types of configuration changes. This is done with the android:configChanges attribute in its manifest. For any types of configuration changes you say that you handle there, you will receive a call to your current activity's onConfigurationChanged(Configuration) method instead of being restarted. If a configuration change involves any that you do not handle, however, the activity will still be restarted and onConfigurationChanged(Configuration) will not be called.

Broadcast Reciever
___________________________________________

Android apps(compoents) can send or receive broadcast messages from the Android system and other Android apps, similar to the 
	publish-subscribe design pattern. 
	---------------------------------
These broadcasts are sent when an event of interest occurs. 

For example, the Android system sends broadcasts when various system events occur, 
	such as when the system boots up or the device starts charging. 
	Apps can also send custom broadcasts, 
		for example, to notify other apps of something that they might be interested in 
			(for example, some new data has been downloaded).

___________________________________________
Intent and Intent Filters
___________________________________________

An Intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component. Although intents facilitate communication between components in several ways, there are three fundamental use cases:

___________________________________________
onSaveInstanceState
___________________________________________

/**
 * Called to retrieve per-instance state from an activity before being killed
 * so that the state can be restored in {@link #onCreate} or
 * {@link #onRestoreInstanceState} (the {@link Bundle} populated by this method
 * will be passed to both).
 *
 
 * <p>This method is called before an activity may be killed so that when it
 * comes back some time in the future it can restore its state.  

 For example,
 * if activity B is launched in front of activity A, and at some point activity
 * A is killed to reclaim resources, activity A will have a chance to save the
 * current state of its user interface via this method so that when the user
 * returns to activity A, the state of the user interface can be restored
 * via {@link #onCreate} or {@link #onRestoreInstanceState}.


 *
 * <p>Do not confuse this method with activity lifecycle callbacks such as
 * {@link #onPause}, which is always called when an activity is being placed
 * in the background or on its way to destruction, or {@link #onStop} which
 * is called before destruction.  


 One example of when {@link #onPause} and
 * {@link #onStop} is called and not this method is when a user navigates back
 * from activity B to activity A: there is no need to call {@link #onSaveInstanceState} * on B because that particular instance will never be restored, so the system avoids calling it.  

 An example when {@link #onPause} is called and
 * not {@link #onSaveInstanceState} is when activity B is launched in front of activity A: the system may avoid calling {@link #onSaveInstanceState} on activity A if it isn't killed during the lifetime of B since the state of the user interface of
 
 * A will stay intact.
 *
 * <p>The default implementation takes care of most of the UI per-instance
 * state for you by calling {@link android.view.View#onSaveInstanceState()} on each
 * view in the hierarchy that has an id, and by saving the id of the currently
 * focused view (all of which is restored by the default implementation of
 * {@link #onRestoreInstanceState}).  If you override this method to save additional
 * information not captured by each individual view, you will likely want to
 * call through to the default implementation, otherwise be prepared to save
 * all of the state of each view yourself.
 *
 * <p>If called, this method will occur after {@link #onStop} for applications
 * targeting platforms starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P}.
 * For applications targeting earlier platform versions this method will occur
 * before {@link #onStop} and there are no guarantees about whether it will
 * occur before or after {@link #onPause}.
 *
 * @param outState Bundle in which to place your saved state.
 *
 * @see #onCreate
 * @see #onRestoreInstanceState
 * @see #onPause
 */
protected void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {

/**
 * This is the same as {@link #onSaveInstanceState} but is called for activities
 * created with the attribute {@link android.R.attr#persistableMode} set to
 * <code>persistAcrossReboots</code>. The {@link android.os.PersistableBundle} passed

Android Services
___________________________________________

A Service is an application component that can perform long-running operations in the background, and it doesn't provide a user interface. 


Another application component can start a service, and it continues to run in the background even if the user switches to another application. 


Additionally, a component can bind to a service to interact with it and even perform interprocess communication (IPC). 

For example, a service can handle network transactions, play music, perform file I/O, or interact with a content provider, all from the background.

These are the three different types of services:


Foreground Bucket

	A foreground service performs some operation that is noticeable to the user. 

	For Example:
		Download In Service( In Background ) and Updating UI

	For Example: an audio app would use a foreground service to play an audio track. 
		Foreground services must display a Notification. 
	
	NOTE : Foreground services continue running even when the user isn't interacting with the app.


Background Bucket

	A background service performs an operation that isn't directly noticed by the user. 

	For Example:
		Angry Bird Background Music is Played In Background Service
	
	For Example: if an app used a service to compact its storage, that would usually be a background service.

	Note: If your app targets API level 26 or higher, the system imposes restrictions on running background services when the app itself isn't in the foreground. 

		In most cases like this, your app should use a scheduled job instead.

Bound Bucket

	A service is bound when an application component binds to it by calling bindService(). 

	A bound service offers a client-server interface that allows components to interact with the service, send requests, receive results, and even do so across processes with interprocess communication (IPC). 

	A bound service runs only as long as another application component is bound to it. Multiple components can bind to the service at once, but when all of them unbind, the service is destroyed.

VERY IMPORTANT
	Although this documentation generally discusses started and bound services separately

	your service can work both ways—it can be started (to run indefinitely) and also allow binding. 

	It's simply a matter of whether you implement a couple of callback methods: onStartCommand() to allow components to start it and onBind() to allow binding.


Regardless 
	of whether your service is started, bound, or both, 

	Any application component can use the service (even from a separate application) in the same way that any component can use an activity—by starting it with an Intent. 

	However, you can declare the service as private in the manifest file and block access from other applications. This is discussed more in the section about Declaring the service in the manifest.

CAUTION:

	A service runs in the main thread of its hosting process; the service does not create its own thread and does not run in a separate process unless you specify otherwise. 

	If your service is going to perform any CPU-intensive work or blocking operations, such as MP3 playback or networking, 

	you should create a new thread within the service to complete that work. By using a separate thread, you can reduce the risk of Application Not Responding (ANR) errors, and the application's main thread can remain dedicated to user interaction with your activities.


Choosing between a service and a thread
___________________________________________

	A service is simply a component that can run in the background(provided develper design so), 

	Even when the user is not interacting with your application, so you should create a service only if that is what you need.

	If you must perform work outside of your main thread, but only while the user is interacting with your application, you should instead create a new thread. 

	For Example:
		if you want to play some music, but only while your activity is running, you might create a thread in onCreate(), start running it in onStart(), and stop it in onStop(). 

		Also consider using AsyncTask or HandlerThread instead of the traditional Thread class. See the Processes and Threading document for more information about threads.

REMEMBER:
	 that if you do use a service, it still runs in your application's main thread by default, 

	 so you should still create a new thread within the service if it performs intensive or blocking operations.


___________________________________________
Service Class The basics
___________________________________________

To create a service, you must create a subclass of Service or use one of its existing subclasses. 


	In your implementation, you must override some callback methods that handle key aspects of the service lifecycle and provide a mechanism that allows the components to bind to the service, if appropriate. 

	These are the most important callback methods that you should override:

	onCreate()
		The system invokes this method to perform one-time setup procedures when the service is initially created (before it calls either onStartCommand() or onBind()). 

		If the service is already running, this method is not called.

	onStartCommand()

		The system invokes this method by calling startService() when another component (such as an activity) requests that the service be started. 

		When this method executes, the service is started and can run in the background indefinitely. 

		If you implement this, it is your responsibility to stop the service when its work is complete by calling stopSelf() or stopService(). 

		If you only want to provide binding, you don't need to implement this method.

	onBind()

		The system invokes this method by calling bindService() when another component wants to bind with the service (such as to perform RPC). 

		In your implementation of this method, you must provide an interface that clients use to communicate with the service by returning an IBinder. 

		You must always implement this method; however, if you don't want to allow binding, you should return null.


	onDestroy()

		The system invokes this method when the service is no longer used and is being destroyed. 

		Your service should implement this to clean up any resources such as threads, registered listeners, or receivers. This is the last call that the service receives.

		If a component starts the service by calling startService() (which results in a call to onStartCommand()), the service continues to run until it stops itself with stopSelf() or another component stops it by calling stopService().


	If a component calls bindService() to create the service and onStartCommand() is not called, the service runs only as long as the component is bound to it. After the service is unbound from all of its clients, the system destroys it.


IMPORTANT
	The Android system stops a service only when memory is low and it must recover system resources for the activity that has user focus. 

	Foreground Bucket
		If the service is bound to an activity that has user focus, it's less likely to be killed; if the service is declared to run in the foreground, it's rarely killed. 

	Background Bucket
		If the service is started and is long-running, the system lowers its position in the list of background tasks over time	, and the service becomes highly susceptible to killing—

	DESIGN DECISION: REMEMBER Any Components Can Come and Go Anytime!
		if your service is started, you must design it to gracefully handle restarts by the system. 

		If the system kills your service, it restarts it as soon as resources become available, but this also depends on the value that you return from onStartCommand(). 

		For more information about when the system might destroy a service, see the Processes and Threading document.

	There are other attributes that you can include in the <service> element to define properties such as the permissions that are required to start the service and the process in which the service should run. 

	The android:name attribute is the only required attribute—it specifies the class name of the service. 

	After you publish your application, leave this name unchanged to avoid the risk of breaking code due to dependence on explicit intents to start or bind the service (read the blog post, Things That Cannot Change).


CAUTION:
	Caution: To ensure that your app is secure, 

	Always use an explicit intent when starting a Service and don't declare intent filters for your services. 

	Using an implicit intent to start a service is a security hazard because you cannot be certain of the service that responds to the intent, and the user cannot see which service starts.

	Beginning with Android 5.0 (API level 21), the system throws an exception if you call bindService() with an implicit intent.

	You can ensure that your service is available to only your app by including the android:exported attribute and setting it to false. 
	This effectively stops other apps from starting your service, even when using an explicit intent.

IMPORTANT NOTE
	Users can see what services are running on their device. If they see a service that they don't recognize or trust, they can stop the service. 

	In order to avoid having your service stopped accidentally by users, you need to add the android:description attribute to the <service> element in your app manifest. 

	In the description, provide a short sentence explaining what the service does and what benefits it provides.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Stopping Service

	When a service is started, it has a lifecycle that's independent of the component that started it. 

	The service can run in the background indefinitely, even if the component that started it is destroyed. As such, the service should stop itself when its job is complete by calling stopSelf(), or another component can stop it by calling stopService().


	An application component such as an activity can start the service by calling startService() and passing an Intent that specifies the service and includes any data for the service to use. 

	The service receives this Intent in the onStartCommand() method.


	For Example: Syncing Data To Server/DataBase
		For instance, suppose an activity needs to save some data to an online database. The activity can start a companion service and deliver it the data to save by passing an intent to startService(). T

		the service receives the intent in onStartCommand(), connects to the Internet, and performs the database transaction. When the transaction is complete, the service stops itself and is destroyed.

CAUTION:
	A service runs in the same process as the application in which it is declared and in the main thread of that application by default. 

	If your service performs intensive or blocking operations while the user interacts with an activity from the same application, the service slows down activity performance. 

	To avoid impacting application performance, start a new thread inside the service.


Two classes you can extend to create a started service:

Service
	This is the base class for all services. When you extend this class, it's important to create a new thread in which the service can complete all of its work; the service uses your application's main thread by default, which can slow the performance of any activity that your application is running.

IntentService
	This is a subclass of Service that uses a worker thread to handle all of the start requests, one at a time. This is the best option if you don't require that your service handle multiple requests simultaneously. 

	Implement onHandleIntent(), which receives the intent for each start request so that you can complete the background work.

BEST PRACTICES
	Extending Service or IntentService class

	Because most of the started services don't need to handle multiple requests simultaneously (which can actually be a dangerous multi-threading scenario), 

	it's best that you implement your service using the IntentService class.

___________________________________________
The IntentService class does the following:
___________________________________________

	It creates a default worker thread that executes all of the intents that are delivered to onStartCommand(), separate from your application's main thread.

	Creates a work queue that passes one intent at a time to your onHandleIntent() implementation, so you never have to worry about multi-threading.

	Stops the service after all of the start requests are handled, so you never have to call stopSelf().

	Provides a default implementation of onBind() that returns null.

	Provides a default implementation of onStartCommand() that sends the intent to the work queue and then to your onHandleIntent() implementation.

	If you decide to also override other callback methods, such as onCreate(), onStartCommand(), or onDestroy(), be sure to call the super implementation so that the IntentService can properly handle the life of the worker thread.

	Besides onHandleIntent(), the only method from which you don't need to call the super class is onBind(). You need to implement this only if your service allows binding


Extending the Service class
	Using IntentService makes your implementation of a started service very simple. If, however, you require your service to perform multi-threading (instead of processing start requests through a work queue), you can extend the Service class to handle each intent.



The return value from onStartCommand() must be one of the following constants:

START_NOT_STICKY

	If the system kills the service after onStartCommand() returns, 

		do not recreate the service unless there are pending intents to deliver. 

	This is the safest option to avoid running your service when not necessary and when your application can simply restart any unfinished jobs.

START_STICKY

	If the system kills the service after onStartCommand() returns,
	 	recreate the service and call onStartCommand(), but do not redeliver the last intent. 

	 Instead, the system calls onStartCommand() with a null intent unless there are pending intents to start the service.

	  In that case, those intents are delivered. This is suitable for media players (or similar services) that are not executing commands but are running indefinitely and waiting for a job.

START_REDELIVER_INTENT
	
	If the system kills the service after onStartCommand() returns,
	 recreate the service and call onStartCommand() with the last intent that was delivered to the service. 

	 Any pending intents are delivered in turn. 

	 This is suitable for services that are actively performing a job that should be immediately resumed, such as downloading a file.


IMPORTANT NOTE:

	Note: If your app targets API level 26 or higher, the system imposes restrictions on using or creating background services unless the app itself is in the foreground(Bucket). 

	If an app needs to create a foreground(Bucket) service, the app should call startForegroundService(). 

	That method creates a background(Bucket) service, but the method signals to the system that the service will promote itself to the foreground(Bucket). 

	Once the service has been created, the service must call its startForeground() method within five seconds.


The startService() method returns immediately, and the Android system calls the service's onStartCommand() method. If the service isn't already running, the system first calls onCreate(), and then it calls onStartCommand().



If the service doesn't also provide binding, 
	the intent that is delivered with startService() is the only mode of communication between the application component and the service. 

	However, if you want the service to send a result back, the client that starts the service can create a PendingIntent for a broadcast (with getBroadcast()) and deliver it to the service in the Intent that starts the service. 

	The service can then use the broadcast to deliver a result.


Multiple requests to start the service result in multiple corresponding calls to the service's onStartCommand(). However, only one request to stop the service (with stopSelf() or stopService()) is required to stop it.


___________________________________________
Stopping Service
___________________________________________

If your service handles multiple requests to onStartCommand() concurrently, you shouldn't stop the service when you're done processing a start request, as you might have received a new start request (stopping at the end of the first request would terminate the second one). To avoid this problem, you can use stopSelf(int) to ensure that your request to stop the service is always based on the most recent start request. That is, when you call stopSelf(int), you pass the ID of the start request (the startId delivered to onStartCommand()) to which your stop request corresponds. Then, if the service receives a new start request before you are able to call stopSelf(int), the ID doesn't match and the service doesn't stop.

CAUTION:
	Caution: To avoid wasting system resources and consuming battery power, ensure that your application stops its services when it's done working. If necessary, other components can stop the service by calling stopService(). Even if you enable binding for the service, you must always stop the service yourself if it ever receives a call to onStartCommand().

___________________________________________
Creating a bound service
___________________________________________

	A bound service is one that allows application components to bind to it by calling bindService() to create a long-standing connection. It generally doesn't allow components to start it by calling startService().

	Create a bound service when you want to interact with the service from activities and other components in your application or to expose some of your application's functionality to other applications through interprocess communication (IPC).

	To create a bound service, implement the onBind() callback method to return an IBinder that defines the interface for communication with the service. Other application components can then call bindService() to retrieve the interface and begin calling methods on the service. 

	The service lives only to serve the application component that is bound to it, so when there are no components bound to the service, the system destroys it. 

	You do not need to stop a bound service in the same way that you must when the service is started through onStartCommand().


	To create a bound service, you must define the interface that specifies how a client can communicate with the service. This interface between the service and a client must be an implementation of IBinder and is what your service must return from the onBind() callback method. After the client receives the IBinder, it can begin interacting with the service through that interface.

	Multiple clients can bind to the service simultaneously. When a client is done interacting with the service, it calls unbindService() to unbind. When there are no clients bound to the service, the system destroys the service.

	There are multiple ways to implement a bound service, and the implementation is more complicated than a started service. For these reasons, the bound service discussion appears in a separate document about Bound Services.


___________________________________________
Sending notifications to the user
___________________________________________


	When a service is running, it can notify the user of events using Toast Notifications or Status Bar Notifications.

	A toast notification is a message that appears on the surface of the current window for only a moment before disappearing. A status bar notification provides an icon in the status bar with a message, which the user can select in order to take an action (such as start an activity).

	Usually, a status bar notification is the best technique to use when background work such as a file download has completed, and the user can now act on it. When the user selects the notification from the expanded view, the notification can start an activity (such as to display the downloaded file).

See the Toast Notifications or Status Bar Notifications developer guides for more information.


______________________________________________
Accessing a provider
______________________________________________

	When you want to access data in a content provider, you use the ContentResolver object in your application's Context to communicate with the provider as a client. 

	The ContentResolver object communicates with the provider object, an instance of a class that implements ContentProvider.

	 The provider object receives data requests from clients, performs the requested action, and returns the results. 

	 This object has methods that call identically-named methods in the provider object, an instance of one of the concrete subclasses of ContentProvider. 

	 The ContentResolver methods provide the basic "CRUD" (create, retrieve, update, and delete) functions of persistent storage


______________________________________________
CursorLoader: Does CRUD IN Background Threads
______________________________________________

	A common pattern for accessing a ContentProvider from your UI uses a CursorLoader to run an asynchronous query in the background. 

	The Activity or Fragment in your UI call a CursorLoader to the query, which in turn gets the ContentProvider using the ContentResolver. 

	Note: 
	To access a provider, your application usually has to request specific permissions in its manifest file. This development pattern is described in more detail in the section Content Provider Permissions.

	Content URIs
	A content URI is a URI that identifies data in a provider. 

	Content URIs include the symbolic name of the entire provider (its authority) and a name that points to a table (a path). 

	When you call a client method to access a table in a provider, the content URI for the table is one of the arguments.

______________________________________________
Data access via intents
______________________________________________

	Intents can provide indirect access to a content provider. 

		You allow the user to access data in a provider even if your application doesn't have access permissions, 

		either by getting a result intent back from an application that has permissions, 

		or by activating an application that has permissions and letting the user do work in it.


	Getting access with temporary permissions
		You can access data in a content provider, even if you don't have the proper access permissions, 

		by sending an intent to an application that does have the permissions and receiving back a result intent containing "URI" permissions. 

		These are permissions for a specific content URI that last until the activity that receives them is finished. 

		The application that has permanent permissions grants temporary permissions by setting a flag in the result intent:

			Read permission: FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION
			Write permission: FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION

Note: These flags don't give general read or write access to the provider whose authority is contained in the content URI. The access is only for the URI itself.


A provider defines URI permissions for content URIs in its manifest, 

	using the android:grantUriPermission attribute
		 of the <provider> element, as well as the 
		 <grant-uri-permission> child element of the <provider> element

		 The URI permissions mechanism is explained in more detail in the Permissions overview guide.


For Example: 
	you can retrieve data for a contact in the Contacts Provider, 
	even if you don't have the READ_CONTACTS permission. 

	You might want to do this in an application that sends e-greetings to a contact on their birthday. 

	Instead of requesting READ_CONTACTS, which gives you access to all of the user's contacts and all of their information, you prefer to let the user control which contacts are used by your application. To do this, you use the following process:
______________________________________________
Contract Classes
______________________________________________

	A contract class defines constants that help applications work with the content URIs, column names, intent actions, and other features of a content provider. 

	Contract classes are not included automatically with a provider; the provider's developer has to define them and then make them available to other developers. Many of the providers included with the Android platform have corresponding contract classes in the package android.provider.
______________________________________________
Android Process Architecture
______________________________________________
 
 	Setting up a new Linux process and the runtime is not an instantaneous operation. It can degrade performance and have a noticeable impact on the user experience.

 	The system tries to shorten the startup time for Android applications by starting a special process called Zygote on system boot. Zygote has the entire set of core libraries preloaded. 

 	New application processes are forked from the Zygote process without copying the core libraries, which are shared across all applications.



Android Application Termination 
______________________________________________

	A process is created at the start of the application and finishes when the system wants to free up resources. 

	Because a user may request an application at any later time, the runtime avoids destroying all its resources until the number of live applications leads to an actual shortage of resources across the system. Hence, an application isn’t auto‐ matically terminated even when all of its components have been destroyed.

	When the system is low on resources, it’s up to the runtime to decide which process should be killed. To make this decision, the system imposes a ranking on each process depending on the application’s visibility and the components that are currently executing. 

	In the following ranking, the bottom-ranked processes are forced to quit before the higher-ranked ones. 

	With the highest first, the process ranks(Buckets) are:

	Foreground Bucket
		Application has a visible component in front, Service is bound to an Activity in front in a remote process, or BroadcastReceiver is running.
	
	Visible Bucket
		Application has a visible component but is partly obscured.
	
	Service Bucket
		Service is executing in the background and is not tied to a visible component.
	
	Background Bucket
		A nonvisible Activity. This is the process level that contains most applications.
	
	Empty Bucket
		A process without active components. Empty processes are kept around to improve startup times, but they are the first to be terminated when the system reclaims resources.

______________________________________________
Processes and Threads in Android
______________________________________________

	When an application component starts and the application does not have any other components running, the Android system starts a new Linux process for the application with a single thread of execution. 

		Process Name will be "Manifest Level PackageName"

	By default, all components of the same application run in the same process and thread (called the "main" thread). 

		If an application component starts and there already exists a process for that application (because another component from the application exists), then the component is started within that process and uses the same thread of execution. 

		android:process="Manifest Level PackageName"
	
	However, you can arrange for different components in your application to run in separate processes, and you can create additional threads for any process.

		android:process="PackageName"


BEST PRACTICES:
	By default, all components of the same application run in the same process and most applications should not change this.


	The manifest entry for each type of component element—<activity>, <service>, <receiver>, and <provider>—supports an 
			android:process="PackageName" attribute

	You can also set android:process so that components of different applications run in the same process.

		Provided that the applications share the same Linux user ID and are signed with the same certificates.

	The <application> element also supports an android:process attribute, to set a default value that applies to all components.

Process Killability In Android
______________________________________________

	Android might decide to shut down a process at some point, when memory is low and required by other processes that are more immediately serving the user. Application components running in the process that's killed are consequently destroyed. A process is started again for those components when there's again work for them to do.

	When deciding which processes to kill, the Android system weighs their relative importance to the user. For example, it more readily shuts down a process hosting activities that are no longer visible on screen, compared to a process hosting visible activities. The decision whether to terminate a process, therefore, depends on the state of the components running in that process.


	1. A foreground process is one that is required for what the user is currently doing. Various application components can cause its containing process to be considered foreground in different ways. A process is considered to be in the foreground if any of the following conditions hold:
		
		It is running an Activity at the top of the screen that the user is interacting with (its onResume() method has been called).
		
		It has a BroadcastReceiver that is currently running (its BroadcastReceiver.onReceive() method is executing).
		
		It has a Service that is currently executing code in one of its callbacks (Service.onCreate(), Service.onStart(), or Service.onDestroy()).


		There will only ever be a few such processes in the system, and these will only be killed as a last resort if memory is so low that not even these processes can continue to run. Generally, at this point, the device has reached a memory paging state, so this action is required in order to keep the user interface responsive.


	2. A visible process is doing work that the user is currently aware of, so killing it would have a noticeable negative impact on the user experience. A process is considered visible in the following conditions:
		
		It is running an Activity that is visible to the user on-screen but not in the foreground (its onPause() method has been called). This may occur, for example, if the foreground Activity is displayed as a dialog that allows the previous Activity to be seen behind it.
		
		It has a Service that is running as a foreground service, through Service.startForeground() (which is asking the system to treat the service as something the user is aware of, or essentially visible to them).
		
		It is hosting a service that the system is using for a particular feature that the user is aware, such as a live wallpaper, input method service, etc.

		
		The number of these processes running in the system is less bounded than foreground processes, but still relatively controlled. These processes are considered extremely important and will not be killed unless doing so is required to keep all foreground processes running.


	3. A service process is one holding a Service that has been started with the startService() method. Though these processes are not directly visible to the user, they are generally doing things that the user cares about (such as background network data upload or download), so the system will always keep such processes running unless there is not enough memory to retain all foreground and visible processes.
		
		Services that have been running for a long time (such as 30 minutes or more) may be demoted in importance to allow their process to drop to the cached LRU list described next.

			This helps avoid situations where very long running services with memory leaks or other problems consume so much RAM that they prevent the system from making effective use of cached processes.

	4. A cached process is one that is not currently needed, so the system is free to kill it as desired when memory is needed elsewhere. In a normally behaving system, these are the only processes involved in memory management: a well running system will have multiple cached processes always available (for more efficient switching between applications) and regularly kill the oldest ones as needed. Only in very critical (and undesireable) situations will the system get to a point where all cached processes are killed and it must start killing service processes.

		These processes often hold one or more Activity instances that are not currently visible to the user (the onStop() method has been called and returned). Provided they implement their Activity life-cycle correctly (see Activity for more details), when the system kills such processes it will not impact the user's experience when returning to that app: it can restore the previously saved state when the associated activity is recreated in a new process.

		These processes are kept in a pseudo-LRU list, where the last process on the list is the first killed to reclaim memory. The exact policy of ordering on this list is an implementation detail of the platform, but generally it will try to keep more useful processes (one hosting the user's home application, the last activity they saw, etc) before other types of processes. Other policies for killing processes may also be applied: hard limits on the number of processes allowed, limits on the amount of time a process can stay continually cached, etc.

	When deciding how to classify a process, the system will base its decision on the most important level found among all the components currently active in the process. See the Activity, Service, and BroadcastReceiver documentation for more detail on how each of these components contribute to the overall life-cycle of a process. The documentation for each of these classes describes in more detail how they impact the overall life-cycle of their application.

	A process's priority may also be increased based on other dependencies a process has to it. For example, if process A has bound to a Service with the Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE flag or is using a ContentProvider in process B, then process B's classification will always be at least as important as process A's.


______________________________________________
Threads in Android
______________________________________________

When an application is launched, the system creates a thread of execution for the application, called "main." This thread is very important because it is in charge of dispatching events to the appropriate user interface widgets, including drawing events. 

	It is also almost always the thread in which your application interacts with components from the Android UI toolkit (components from the android.widget and android.view packages). 

	As such, the main thread is also sometimes called the UI thread. However, under special circumstances, an app's main thread might not be its UI thread; for more information, see Thread annotations.

The system does not create a separate thread for each instance of a component. All components that run in the same process are instantiated in the UI thread, and system calls to each component are dispatched from that thread. 

	Consequently, methods that respond to system callbacks (such as onKeyDown() to report user actions or a lifecycle callback method) always run in the UI thread of the process.


For instance, when the user touches a button on the screen, your app's UI thread dispatches the touch event to the widget, which in turn sets its pressed state and posts an invalidate request to the event queue. The UI thread dequeues the request and notifies the widget that it should redraw itself.

When your app performs intensive work in response to user interaction, this single thread model can yield poor performance unless you implement your application properly. 

Specifically, if everything is happening in the UI thread, performing long operations such as network access or database queries will block the whole UI. When the thread is blocked, no events can be dispatched, including drawing events. From the user's perspective, the application appears to hang. Even worse, if the UI thread is blocked for more than a few seconds (about 5 seconds currently) the user is presented with the infamous "application not responding" (ANR) dialog. The user might then decide to quit your application and uninstall it if they are unhappy.


VERY IMPORTANT
	Additionally, the Android UI toolkit is not thread-safe. So, you must not manipulate your UI from a worker thread—you must do all manipulation to your user interface from the UI thread. Thus, there are simply two rules to Android's single thread model:

	Do not block the UI thread
	Do not access the Android UI toolkit from outside the UI thread


	Worker threads
		Because of the single threaded model described above, it's vital to the responsiveness of your application's UI that you do not block the UI thread. If you have operations to perform that are not instantaneous, you should make sure to do them in separate threads ("background" or "worker" threads).

		However, note that you cannot update the UI from any thread other than the UI thread or the "main" thread.

		To fix this problem, Android offers several ways to access the UI thread from other threads. Here is a list of methods that can help:

		Activity.runOnUiThread(Runnable)
		View.post(Runnable)
		View.postDelayed(Runnable, long)

______________________________________________
Using AsyncTask
______________________________________________
	AsyncTask allows you to perform asynchronous work on your user interface. It performs the blocking operations in a worker thread and then publishes the results on the UI thread, without requiring you to handle threads and/or handlers yourself.

	To use it, you must subclass AsyncTask and implement the doInBackground() callback method, which runs in a pool of background threads. To update your UI, you should implement onPostExecute(), which delivers the result from doInBackground() and runs in the UI thread, so you can safely update your UI. You can then run the task by calling execute() from the UI thread.

	You should read the AsyncTask reference for a full understanding on how to use this class.

	AsyncTask's generic types
	-------------------------
		The three types used by an asynchronous task are the following:

		Params, the type of the parameters sent to the task upon execution.
		Progress, the type of the progress units published during the background computation.
		Result, the type of the result of the background computation.
		Not all types are always used by an asynchronous task. To mark a type as unused, simply use the type Void:

Android Security Tips and Practices
______________________________________________

	Android has built-in security features that significantly reduce the frequency and impact of application security issues. 

		The system is designed so that you can typically build your apps with the default system and file permissions and avoid difficult decisions about security.

	The following core security features help you build secure apps:

		The Android Application Sandbox, which isolates your app data and code execution from other apps.

		An application framework with robust implementations of common security functionality such as cryptography, permissions, and secure IPC.

		Technologies like ASLR, NX, ProPolice, safe_iop, OpenBSD dlmalloc, OpenBSD calloc, and Linux mmap_min_addr to mitigate risks associated with common memory management errors.

		An encrypted file system that can be enabled to protect data on lost or stolen devices.

		User-granted permissions to restrict access to system features and user data.

		Application-defined permissions to control application data on a per-app basis.

Store data
______________________________________________
	The most common security concern for an application on Android is whether the data that you save on the device is accessible to other apps. There are three fundamental ways to save data on the device:

		Internal storage.
		External storage.
		Content providers.


		Use internal storage
		--------------------
		
		By default, files that you create on internal storage are accessible only to your app. Android implements this protection, and it's sufficient for most applications.

			Generally, avoid the MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE or MODE_WORLD_READABLE modes for IPC files because they do not provide the ability to limit data access to particular applications, nor do they provide any control of data format. 

			If you want to share your data with other app processes, instead consider using a content provider, which offers read and write permissions to other apps and can make dynamic permission grants on a case-by-case basis.

			To provide additional protection for sensitive data, you can encrypt local files using the Security library. This measure can provide protection for a lost device without file system encryption.

		Use external storage
		---------------------

			Files created on external storage, such as SD cards, are globally readable and writable. Because external storage can be removed by the user and also modified by any application, don't store sensitive information using external storage.

			To read and write files on external storage in a more secure way, consider using the Security library, which provides the EncryptedFile class.

			You should Perform input validation when handling data from external storage as you would with data from any untrusted source. 

				You should not store executables or class files on external storage prior to dynamic loading. 

				If your app does retrieve executable files from external storage, the files should be signed and cryptographically verified prior to dynamic loading.

		Use content providers
		---------------------
		Content providers offer a structured storage mechanism that can be limited to your own application or exported to allow access by other applications. 

			If you do not intend to provide other applications with access to your ContentProvider, mark them as android:exported=false in the application manifest.

			 Otherwise, set the android:exported attribute to true to allow other apps to access the stored data.

		When creating a ContentProvider that is exported for use by other applications, 

			you can specify a single permission for reading and writing, or you can specify distinct permissions for reading and writing. 

			You should limit your permissions to those required to accomplish the task at hand. Keep in mind that it’s usually easier to add permissions later to expose new functionality than it is to take them away and impact existing users.

		If you are using a content provider for sharing data between only your own apps, 
			
			it is preferable to use the android:protectionLevel attribute set to signature protection. 

				Signature permissions do not require user confirmation, so they provide a better user experience and more controlled access to the content provider data when the apps accessing the data are signed with the same key.

		Content providers can also provide more granular access 

			by declaring the android:grantUriPermissions attribute 
				and using the FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION and FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION flags in the Intent object that activates the component. 

				The scope of these permissions can be further limited by the <grant-uri-permission> element.

			When accessing a content provider, use parameterized query methods such as query(), update(), and delete() 
				to avoid potential SQL injection from untrusted sources. 
				Note that using parameterized methods is not sufficient if the selection argument is built by concatenating user data prior to submitting it to the method.

			Don't have a false sense of security about the write permission. 

				The write permission allows SQL statements that make it possible for some data to be confirmed using creative WHERE clauses and parsing the results. 

				For example, an attacker might probe for the presence of a specific phone number in a call log by modifying a row only if that phone number already exists. 

				If the content provider data has predictable structure, the write permission may be equivalent to providing both reading and writing.

______________________________________________
Use permissions
______________________________________________
	Because Android sandboxes applications from each other, applications must explicitly share resources and data. 

	They do this by declaring the permissions they need for additional capabilities not provided by the basic sandbox, including access to device features such as the camera.

	Request permissions
	-------------------
	You should minimize the number of permissions that your app requests. 

		Restricting access to sensitive permissions reduces the risk of inadvertently misusing those permissions, improves user adoption, and makes your app less vulnerable for attackers. 
		Generally, if a permission is not required for your app to function, don't request it. If there is a feature that the app can't run without, declare it using a <uses-feature> element in the manifest file.

		If it's possible to design your application in a way that does not require any permissions, that is preferable. 

		For example, 
			Rather than requesting access to device information to create a unique identifier, create a GUID for your application (see the section about Handling user data). Or, rather than using external storage (which requires permission), 

			Store data on the internal storage.

		In addition to requesting permissions, your application can use the <permission> element to protect IPC that is security sensitive and is exposed to other applications, such as a ContentProvider.

			In general, we recommend using access controls other than user confirmed permissions where possible because permissions can be confusing for users. 

				For Example, 
				consider using the signature protection level on permissions for IPC communication between applications provided by a single developer.

		Do not leak permission-protected data. 
			This occurs when your app exposes data over IPC that is available only because your app has permission to access that data. 

			The clients of your app's IPC interface may not have that same data-access permission. 

			More details on the frequency and potential effects of this issue appear in the research paper Permission Re-Delegation: Attacks and Defenses , published at USENIX.

	Create permissions
	------------------
	Generally, you should strive to define as few permissions as possible while satisfying your security requirements. 

		Creating a new permission is relatively uncommon for most applications, because the system-defined permissions cover many situations. Where appropriate, perform access checks using existing permissions.

		If you must create a new permission, consider whether you can accomplish your task with a signature protection level.

		 Signature permissions are transparent to the user and allow access only by applications signed by the same developer as the application performing the permission check. 

		 If the new permission is still required, it's declared in the app manifest using the <permission> element. 

		 Apps that wish to use the new permission can reference it by each adding a <uses-permission> element in their respective manifest files. 

		 You can also add permissions dynamically by using the addPermission() method.

	If you create a permission with the dangerous protection level, there are a number of complexities that you need to consider:

		The permission must have a string that concisely expresses to a user the security decision they are required to make.

		The permission string must be localized to many different languages.

		Users may choose not to install an application because a permission is confusing or perceived as risky.

		Applications may request the permission when the creator of the permission has not been installed.

		Each of these poses a significant nontechnical challenge for you as the developer while also confusing your users, which is why we discourages the use of the dangerous permission level.

______________________________________________
android:protectionLevel
______________________________________________
Characterizes the potential risk implied in the permission and indicates the procedure the system should follow when determining whether or not to grant the permission to an application requesting it.

Each protection level consists of a base permission type and zero or more flags. For example, the "dangerous" protection level has no flags. In contrast, the protection level "signature|privileged" is a combination of the "signature" base permission type and the "privileged" flag.

The following table shows all base permission types. For a list of flags, see protectionLevel.


	"normal"
	--------
	The default value. A lower-risk permission that gives requesting applications access to isolated application-level features, with minimal risk to other applications, the system, or the user. 

	The system automatically grants this type of permission to a requesting application at installation, without asking for the user's explicit approval (though the user always has the option to review these permissions before installing).


	"dangerous"	
	-----------
	A higher-risk permission that would give a requesting application access to private user data or control over the device that can negatively impact the user.

	 Because this type of permission introduces potential risk, the system may not automatically grant it to the requesting application. 

	 For example, any dangerous permissions requested by an application may be displayed to the user and require confirmation before proceeding, or some other approach may be taken to avoid the user automatically allowing the use of such facilities.

	"signature"	
	-----------
	 A permission that the system grants only if the requesting application is signed with the same certificate as the application that declared the permission. 

	 If the certificates match, the system automatically grants the permission without notifying the user or asking for the user's explicit approval.


	"signatureOrSystem"	
	-------------------
	Old synonym for "signature|privileged". Deprecated in API level 23.

	A permission that the system grants only to applications that are in a dedicated folder on the Android system image or that are signed with the same certificate as the application that declared the permission. 

	Avoid using this option, as the signature protection level should be sufficient for most needs and works regardless of exactly where apps are installed. 

	The "signatureOrSystem" permission is used for certain special situations where multiple vendors have applications built into a system image and need to share specific features explicitly because they are being built together.
